### Development

To start the project locally, run:

```bash
yarn dev
```

Open `http://localhost:3000` with your browser to see the result.

### Scripts

- `yarn dev` — Starts the application in development mode at `http://localhost:3000`.
- `yarn build` — Creates an optimized production build of your application.
- `yarn start` — Starts the application in production mode.
- `yarn type-check` — Validate code using TypeScript compiler.
- `yarn lint` — Runs ESLint for all files in the `src` directory.
- `yarn format` — Runs Prettier for all files in the `src` directory.
- `yarn commit` — Run commitizen. Alternative to `git commit`.

### Path Mapping

TypeScript are pre-configured with custom path mappings. To import components or files, use the `@` prefix.

```tsx
import { Button } from '@/components/Button';

// To import images or other files from the public folder
import avatar from '@/public/avatar.png';
```
